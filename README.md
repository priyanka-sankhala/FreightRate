**Container Types**: In some Excel files, columns like 20’GP and 40’GP represent different container types. Each row may correspond to multiple entries based on these types.

**Layout Adjustments**: Minor layout changes were made during development. Notably, the upload modal was expanded to full width to accommodate Excel files with more than eight columns, ensuring better data visualization.

**Column Mapping**: A column mapping feature is included at the end to facilitate easy identification and alignment of data fields.
